### Week 2 assignments for Coursera Machine Learning: Regression course from the University of Washington.

### Ipython notebook for Gradient Descent Multiple Regression

In this notebook, we will cover estimating multiple regression weights via gradient descent. You will:

*Compute the derivative of the regression weights with respect to a single feature.
*Write a gradient descent function to compute the regression weights given an initial weight vector, step size, and tolerance.
*Use the gradient descent function to estimate regression weights for multiple features
*Write a predict_output() function. This function uses the weights obtained from gradient descent to predict the output for any feature we are interested in predicting (in this case, house price).
