In this notebook, we will use data on house sales in King County, Seattle to predict house prices using simple (one input) linear regression. You will:
* Write a function to compute the Simple Linear Regression weights using the closed form solution
* Write a function to make predictions of the output given the input feature
* Turn the regression around to predict the input given the output
* Compare two different models for predicting house prices
