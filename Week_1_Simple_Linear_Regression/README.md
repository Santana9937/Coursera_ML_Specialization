### Week 1 assignment for Coursera Machine Learning: Regression course from the University of Washington.

### Ipython notebook for Simple Linear Regression


In this notebook, we will use data on house sales in King County, Seattle to predict house prices using simple (one input) linear regression. You will:
* Write a function to compute the Simple Linear Regression weights using the closed form solution
* Write a function to make predictions of the output given the input feature
* Turn the regression around to predict the input given the output
* Compare two different models for predicting house prices
