### Week 6 assignments for Coursera Machine Learning: Regression course from the University of Washington.

### Ipython notebook for Nearest Neighbors & Kernel Regression

http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Santana9937/Regression_ML_Specialization/blob/master/Week_6_NN_Kernel_Reg/assign_1_week-6-local-regression.ipynb

In this notebook, we will implement k-nearest neighbors regression. You will:
  * Find the k-nearest neighbors of a given query input
  * Predict the output for the query input using the k-nearest neighbors
  * Choose the best value of k using a validation set
