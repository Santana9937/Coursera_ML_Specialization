### Week 5 assignments for Coursera Machine Learning: Regression course from the University of Washington.

### Ipython notebook for Feature Selection & Lasso

http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Santana9937/Regression_ML_Specialization/blob/master/Week_5_Lasso/assign_1_week-5-lasso.ipynb

In this notebook, we will use LASSO to select features. You will:
* Run LASSO with different L1 penalties.
* Choose best L1 penalty using a validation set.
* Choose best L1 penalty using a validation set, with additional constraint on the size of subset.

In the second notebook, you will implement your own LASSO solver, using coordinate descent.

In this notebook, you will implement your very own LASSO solver via coordinate descent. You will:
* Write a function to normalize features
* Implement coordinate descent for LASSO
* Explore effects of L1 penalty
