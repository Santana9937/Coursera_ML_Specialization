### Week 3 assignments for Coursera Machine Learning: Regression course from the University of Washington.

### Ipython notebook for Assessing Performance of Polynomial Regression Models

http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Santana9937/Regression_ML_Specialization/blob/master/Week_3_Assessing_Performance/assign_1_polynomial-regression.ipynb

In this notebook, we will compare different regression models in order to assess which model fits best. We will be using polynomial regression as a means to examine this topic. In particular, you will:

* Write a function to take a Series and a degree and return a DataFrame where each column is the Series to a polynomial value up to the total degree e.g. degree = 3 then column 1 is the Series column 2 is the Series squared and column 3 is the Series cubed
* Use matplotlib to visualize polynomial regressions
* Use matplotlib to visualize the same polynomial degree on different subsets of the data
* Use a validation set to select a polynomial degree
* Assess the final fit using test data
